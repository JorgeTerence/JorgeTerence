- 👋 Hi, I’m @JorgeTerence (he/him), a High School student deciding what it wants to do with his future carrer.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development (still learning JS frameworks), Deno for server-side programming, React Native for mobile development.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with my peers on a mobile aplication called Rastros. The React Native based preview is avaialable at [Rastros Demo](https://github.com/JorgeTerence/Rastros-Demo). The back-end is being worked on at [wild-animals-api](https://github.com/JorgeTerence/wild-animals-api).
<!-- - 🤝 I don't have much free time, but I'd love to participate on free software projects that'd help me learn new technologies and improve my existing ones -->
